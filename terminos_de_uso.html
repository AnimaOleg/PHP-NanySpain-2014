    Description of Services; Limitations; User Responsibilities
        1.1 About Our Services

        Care.com offers various Services to help its users find, coordinate, and maintain quality care. The Services we offer include, among others:
            We enable individuals seeking care services (such as child care, senior care, special needs, pet care, tutoring and housekeeping services) and corporate care providers seeking individual care providers to hire (such as child centers, in-home care agencies, and senior living facilities) (each "Care Seekers") to post jobs on the Site, and we enable individuals and entities who provide care services ("Care Providers") to post profiles on the Site and apply to jobs.
            We provide search functionality on the Site to allow Care Seekers and individual Care Providers to narrow the pool of Care Seekers or Care Providers they are interested in meeting based on their needs and preferences, and we provide a communications platform that allows Care Seekers and Care Providers to communicate without sharing contact information.
            We provide tools and information to help Care Seekers and Care Providers make more informed decisions, such as (i) our safety center, which includes a safety guide and safety resources, (ii) verification dashboards on Care Provider profiles, which enable Care Seekers to check the status of a Care Provider's various verifications, and (iii) a process for Care Seekers to obtain background check reports on individual Care Providers who consent to the running and sharing of those reports.
            We provide a directory of entity Care Providers such as child care centers, family child care centers, nanny agencies, au pairs agencies, summer camps, tutoring centers, in-home care agencies, senior care housing companies and housekeepers that users may contact or request information from.
            For certain Care Seekers who would like additional assistance in narrowing down the list of Care Providers to choose from, we offer the Care Concierge Service through our subsidiary, PIAP.
            For Care Seekers who would like assistance in helping their aging loved ones remain in their homes, we offer our HomeBase Service. Through this Service, we help Care Seekers arrange for personal home care assistance, transportation and other care-related services from third parties we contract with who provide those services (such third parties, along with the individuals who work for them, also "Care Providers"). Please visit our Site for more information on this Service. Certain aspects of the HomeBase Service may be offered through our subsidiary PIAP.
            For certain Care Seekers who enroll in Care.com through their employer's benefits program and for certain other Care Seekers, we offer through our subsidiary, PIAP, a Backup Care Service that enables them to receive periodic emergency backup care from third parties we or PIAP contract with who provide those services (such third parties, along with the individuals who work for them, also "Care Providers"). If you have enrolled in Care.com through your employer's benefits program, please inquire with your benefits department to determine whether this offering is available to you.
            For certain Care Seekers who enroll in Care.com through their employer's benefits program and for certain other Care Seekers, we offer a Senior Care Planning Service that assists families who want to better understand senior care options for themselves or their loved ones. If you have enrolled in Care.com through your employer's benefits program, please inquire with your benefits department to determine whether this offering is available to you.
            We operate a groups platform on the Site that enables Registered Users to communicate and share information with other Registered Users who share a common interest or bond, such as the Working Mothers Group.
            We offer a mobile application, Karoo, that allows users and their Care Providers to stay connected by sharing updates, photos, videos and other information. Users may also invite family and friends to participate.
            We may offer a service that facilitates the payment by Care Seekers to Care Providers via credit card.

        Our Services continue to grow and change. Please refer to our Site for further information about the Services we provide.
        1.2. Limitations of our Services

        We offer a variety of Services to help our users find, coordinate, and maintain quality care. However, we do not employ any Care Providers. Except as set forth below, Care Seekers are the potential employers of Care Providers and are responsible for compliance with all applicable employment and other laws in connection with any employment relationship they establish (such as applicable payroll, tax and minimum wage laws). The only exception is when an individual Care Provider is being provided through a third party service provider we or PIAP contract with, such as a home care agency that provides personal care services through the HomeBase Service, or a nanny agency that provides backup care through our Backup Care Service. In those limited circumstances, unless otherwise provided in the Additional Terms related to those Services, the third party service provider is the employer of the Care Provider.

        Further, we do not have control over the quality, timing, or legality of the services actually delivered by Care Providers, nor of the integrity, responsibility or actions of Care Seekers or Care Providers. We do not refer or recommend either Care Seekers or Care Providers nor do we make any representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, and accuracy of the services provided by Care Providers or the integrity, responsibility or actions of Care Seekers or Care Providers whether in public, private or offline interactions.

        Through the Care Concierge, HomeBase and Senior Care Planning Services, PIAP or we may provide families a customized list of potential individuals, companies and/or agencies to consider based on the information the family provides us regarding their and their loved one's needs and preferences. In providing these services, neither we, PIAP nor our respective employees are making a referral to, or endorsing, any individual, company or agency nor are we or PIAP providing any medical, diagnostic, treatment or clinical service or engaging in any conduct that requires a professional license.

        Through the Backup Care and HomeBase Services, the third parties we or PIAP contract with to provide services in support of that Service select the individual Care Providers from their agency who provide the backup or senior care service. We and PIAP contract with only reputable agencies that have entered into an agreement with us pursuant to which they represent that each of their individual Care Providers has passed a vigorous screening process including background and reference checks. However, each such agency operates independently of Care.com and is not under our control. Accordingly, neither we nor PIAP assumes responsibility for the conduct of, or quality of the services provided by, such agencies or the individual Care Providers they employ or otherwise engage to provide services in support of the Backup Care or HomeBase Services. Any issues concerning the foregoing must be resolved directly with the agency and/or the individual Care Provider the agency selected to provide the services.

        Care Seeker and Care Provider content is primarily user generated, and we do not control or vet user generated content for accuracy as a general matter. Care.com does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of any information provided by Care Providers or Care Seekers on or off this Site. We may offer certain Registered Users the opportunity to verify certain information such as their email address or cell phone number. If we indicate that a Registered User has verified certain information, it means that the user has complied with the process we have established for verifying such information. However, we do not guarantee, nor do we represent or warrant as to, the accuracy of such information.

        Care.com is not responsible for the conduct, whether online or offline, of any Care Seeker, Care Provider or other user of the Site or Services, including without limitation the conduct of PIAP. Moreover, Care.com does not assume and expressly disclaims any liability that may result from the use of information provided on our Site. All users, including both Care Seekers and Care Providers, hereby expressly agree not to hold Care.com (or Care.com's officers, directors, shareholders, employees, subsidiaries, other affiliates, successors, assignees, agents, representatives, advertisers, marketing partners, licensors, independent contractors, recruiters, corporate partners or resellers, or your employer, if you enrolled in Care.com through their employer's benefits program, hereinafter "Affiliates") liable for the actions or inactions of any Care Seeker, Care Provider or other third party or for any information, instruction, advice or services which originated through the Site, and, to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law, Care.com and its Affiliates expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever for any damage, suits, claims, and/or controversies that have arisen or may arise, whether known or unknown therefrom.
        1.3. User Responsibilities

        Any screening of a Care Seeker or Care Provider and his, her or its information by Care.com is limited and should not be taken as complete, accurate, up-to-date or conclusive of the individual's or entity's suitability as an employer or care provider. Registered Users are solely responsible for interviewing, performing background and reference checks on, verifying information provided by, and selecting an appropriate Care Seeker or Care Provider for themselves or their family. The only exception is when a third party we or PIAP contracts with to provide services in support of the Backup Care Service or the HomeBase Service selects on behalf of the Registered User the specific individual Care Provider from the agency who will provide backup or senior care services. In that limited circumstance only, the agency (as opposed to the Registered User) is responsible for screening the Care Provider it selects on behalf of the Registered User.

        Please visit our Safety Center for recommendations on how to make more informed hiring and employment decisions. Each Care Seeker is also responsible for complying with all applicable employment and other laws in connection with any employment relationship they establish, including verifying the age of the Care Provider they select as well as that Care Provider's eligibility to work in the US. If you are a Parent Registered User (as defined in Section 3.3 below), you also agree to assume the responsibilities set forth in Section 3.3 (Teen Providers, Parent Registered Users, and Parent Monitored Accounts).

Parent Registered Users may also log in to, update the settings of and terminate their Teen Provider's account.

        For purposes of these Terms, Parent Registered Users and their Teen Provider are deemed to be Care Providers.

            provide false or inaccurate information when registering an account on Care.com, using the Services or communicating with other Registered Users;
            attempt to re-register with Care.com if we have terminated your account for any or no reason or terminate your registration and re-register in order to prevent a review from being associated with your account;
            interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper functioning of Care.com's Services;
            make any automated use of the system, or take any action that we deem to impose or to potentially impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our servers or network infrastructure;

            use the communication systems provided by or contacts made on Care.com for any commercial solicitation purposes;
            publish or link to malicious content intended to damage or disrupt another user's browser or computer.

        In order to protect our users from prohibited activity, we reserve the right to take appropriate actions, including but not limited to restricting the number of phone numbers a Care Seeker may view or the number of emails a user may send in any 24-hour period to a number which we deem appropriate in our sole discretion.

        Should Care.com find that you violated the terms of this Section or any terms stated herein, Care.com reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to immediately terminate your use of the Site and Services.

        Further, in order to protect the integrity of the Site and the Services, Care.com reserves the right at any time in its sole discretion to block users from certain IP addresses from accessing the Site.
    Background and Verification Checks
        4.1 Care Providers Can Order or Authorize Background Checks about Themselves and Can Authorize the Sharing of Them with Other Members

        Care.com offers the following background check services from consumer reporting agencies: preliminary background checks, preferred and preferred + background checks and premier background checks (collectively "Background Checks"). Preliminary, preferred and preferred + background checks must be ordered by Care Providers about themselves either on their own initiative to increase their chances of employment by Care Seekers or in response to a request by a Care Seeker who is considering hiring them. Premier background checks are ordered by Care Seekers subject to the written authorization of the Care Provider who is the subject of the check. Preliminary background checks are free when requested by a Care Seeker or Care Provider who is a paid subscriber. The other Background Check services require payment of a separate fee by the Member who is initiating the background check request.

        Each of these Background Check services are regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the "FCRA"), and the background reports resulting from these services are considered "consumer reports" under the FCRA. Consumer reports may contain information on your character, general reputation, personal characteristics, and mode of living, including but not limited to consumer credit, criminal history, workers' compensation, driving, employment, military, civil, and educational data and reports.

        Care.com will receive a copy of each Background Check you order or authorize through Care.com. See Section 4.3 below for information regarding Care.com's use of these Background Checks. If you order a preliminary, preferred or preferred + Background Check about yourself, you will be emailed a copy of the results if it does not come back clean. You are responsible for making sure that the email addresses you provide to Care.com is correct, knowing that sensitive information will be sent to it.

        If you order a preliminary, preferred or preferred + Background Check in response to a request by a Care Seeker who is considering hiring you and the check comes back clean or with information that does not result in Care.com suspending or terminating your account, we will forward the check to the Care Seeker who requested it in accordance with your authorization at the time you ordered the check. The results of any preliminary, preferred or preferred + Background Check you order that results in Care.com suspending or terminating your account will not be shared with other users.

        If a Care Seeker orders a premier background check pursuant to your written authorization, the consumer reporting agency that performed the check will provide it directly to the Care Seeker who ordered it based on your authorization that the Care Seeker obtains the check. The results of a premier background check ordered by a Care Seeker pursuant to your written authorization will be shared directly with the Care Seeker regardless of its contents.

        If you have ordered a Background Check through Care.com, we may indicate in your profile that you have completed that check. However, we will not share the results with any other site visitor or Registered User without your specific consent.
        4.2. Special Responsibilities of Care Seekers under FCRA

        Care Seekers may request and receive a copy of a Background Check on a Care Provider, subject to the Care Provider's explicit instructions about who may have access to such a report.

        If you receive a copy of a background report, you warrant that you will use such information only for a purpose permitted by FCRA, such as an employment purpose, and that you will comply with any and all applicable obligations of the FCRA as well as all other applicable consumer reporting laws.

        Your responsibilities in using the information contained the background check can be found at http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fcrajump.shtm. FCRA governs the use of reports obtained from a consumer reporting agency, such as the third party consumer reporting agencies we use.

        If there is negative data in a check you receive, and you choose to take "adverse action" (i.e. choose to pass on that individual's candidacy) on the basis of this negative data, you must agree to take certain procedural steps, which can be found at http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fcrajump.shtm. These include notifying the individual who is the subject of the report of your decision to take adverse action based on information contained in the report and the subject's right to contest the accuracy or completeness of the report. Moreover, if the subject contests the report with the consumer reporting agency, you are required to suspend the hiring process while the agency researches the accuracy and completeness of the report.
        4.3 Care.com May Review and Use Background Checks You Order or Authorize About Yourself

        By using the Site or Services as a Care Provider, you acknowledge and agree Care.com may review and use any Background Checks you have ordered or authorized about yourself for the legitimate business purpose of protecting the safety and integrity of our Site and its users and reserves the right to terminate your membership based on the information contained in such report, even if such information was subsequently dismissed.

        If Care.com terminates your membership or access to the Site on the basis of information in a Background Check, we will notify you and provide you the name and contact information of the consumer reporting agency that created the report. We will also provide you a copy of the report unless the consumer reporting agency has already provided you a copy or access to it. You hereby represent, understand and expressly agree that Care.com does not have control over or assume any responsibility for the quality, accuracy, or reliability of the information included in these Background Checks. Furthermore, any inaccuracies in the report must be addressed with the consumer reporting agency that issued it and not Care.com.
        4.4 Care.com May Order and Use Background Checks About You

        By using the Site or Services as a Care Seeker or Care Provider, you hereby acknowledge and agree that Care.com has the right, but not the obligation, to use a third party consumer reporting agency on an ongoing basis to use your personal information to run periodic background checks on you for the legitimate business purpose of protecting the safety and integrity of our Site and its users ("Internal Background Checks"). Care.com may order these checks when you register with Care.com and thereafter in connection with your continued use of our Services and/or interaction with our Site (such as by contacting or communicating with other members, posting or updating a job or profile, ordering or authorizing a Background Check, etc.).

        These Internal Background Checks are also regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the "FCRA"), and the background reports resulting from these services are considered "consumer reports" under the FCRA. Consumer reports may contain information on your character, general reputation, personal characteristics, and mode of living, including but not limited to consumer credit, criminal history, workers' compensation, driving, employment, military, civil, and educational data and reports.

        You understand and agree that Care.com may review the information provided by the third party consumer reporting agency and that Care.com retains the right to terminate your Care.com registration based on the information it receives from these checks, even if such information was subsequently dismissed. If Care.com terminates your membership or access to the Site on the basis of information in a background report, we will notify you and provide you the name and contact information of the consumer reporting agency that created the report. We will also provide you a copy of the report unless the consumer reporting agency has already provided you a copy or access to it. You hereby represent, understand and expressly agree that Care.com does not have control over or assume any responsibility for the quality, accuracy, or reliability of the information included in these checks. Furthermore, any inaccuracies in the report must be addressed with the consumer reporting agency that issued it (and not Care.com) within the time period specified in your notice.

        BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS AND USING OUR SITE, YOU AGREE TO ALLOW CARE.COM TO PERFORM THESE INTERNAL BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR THE PURPOSES DESCRIBED ABOVE. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THESE INTERNAL BACKGROUND CHECKS TO BE PERFORMED, YOU SHOULD NOT USE CARE.COM. NO FURTHER CONSENT FROM YOU IS REQUIRED FOR THESE CHECKS TO BE PERFORMED.
        4.5. Care.com May Regularly Verify Your Identity and the Accuracy of Your Representations and Warranties

        By registering as a Care Provider or Care Seeker, you authorize Care.com, and acknowledge that for purposes of promoting the safety and integrity of its Site and Service, Care.com reserves the right, but not the obligation, to utilize third party service providers to verify on an ongoing basis that your registration data is accurate and that the representations and warranties in Section 2.2 above addressing legal matters such as complaints, arrests, sex offender status, etc. are also true ("Verification Checks"). These third parties may use data from a variety of sources, under a variety of circumstances, for these site safety purposes including, without limitation, information from national criminal databases, sex offender registries, certain media streams, terrorist watch lists, criminal and fugitive watch lists, fraud watch lists, law enforcement reports, and other data.

        You agree that Care.com may take such action in response to Verification Checks as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion, including without limitation suspending and/or terminating your membership, should it determine that you have violated any representation or warranty or any other provision of these Terms or are otherwise unsuitable for Care.com.

        You also hereby represent, understand and expressly agree that Care.com does not have control over or assume any responsibility for the quality, accuracy, or reliability of the information included in a Verification Check. We do not typically communicate the results of a Verification Check to any third party, though we reserve the right to do so for law enforcement or other safety-related purposes.

        BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AGREE TO ALLOW CARE.COM TO PERFORM THE VERIFICATION CHECKS DESCRIBED ABOVE. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THESE VERIFICATION CHECKS TO BE PERFORMED, YOU SHOULD NOT USE CARE.COM. NO FURTHER CONSENT FROM YOU IS REQUIRED FOR THESE VERIFICATION CHECKS TO BE PERFORMED.
        4.6 Release of Liability for Results of Background Checks, Internal Background Checks, and Verification Checks

        If you decide to use or access information included in a Background Check, you hereby represent, understand and expressly agree that those checks are not always accurate or complete (or based on information that is accurate or complete) and that the specific records searched, and the comprehensiveness of the search, varies by the type of Background Check ordered as well as the state and county where the check is performed. For example, many jurisdictions only include felony conviction records (and not, for example, misdemeanor or arrest records) in the national criminal data base, which is the only data source utilized for preliminary background checks other than the sexual offender registry. Moreover, some states include only registered sex offenders in that database.

        If you decide to access, use, or share information provided by a Background Check, you agree to do so in accordance with applicable law. You also agree to indemnify and hold harmless Care.com from any loss, liability, damage, or costs that may result from such access, use, or sharing of this information regardless of the cause. Care.com does not assume and expressly disclaims, and you hereby agree to release Care.com from, any loss, liability, damage, or costs that may result from the use of information provided in a background report including, without limitation, the inaccuracy or incompleteness of any such information.

        You expressly acknowledge that Care.com has no obligation to perform Background Checks, Internal Background Checks, or Verification Checks on any Registered Users. To the extent Care.com performs such checks on certain Registered Users, the checks are limited and should not be taken as complete, accurate, up-to-date or conclusive evidence of the accuracy of any information those users have provided or of their eligibility to use the Services.
    Termination of Registration

    Should Care.com determine that you are not eligible to use the Services, have violated any terms stated herein or in any of the Additional Terms, are not suitable for participation as a Registered User, or have mis-used or mis-appropriated Site content, including but not limited to use on a "mirrored", competitive, or third party site, Care.com reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to immediately terminate your access to all or part of the Care.com Site, to remove your profile and/or any content posted by or about you from the Site, and/or to terminate your registration in Care.com, with or without notice.

    In any event, Care.com also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to all or part of the Care.com Site, to remove your profile and/or any content posted by or about you from the Site, and/or to terminate your registration in Care.com, for any reason or no reason, with or without notice. If we terminate your registration, we have no obligation to notify you of the reason, if any, for your termination.

    Following any termination of any individual's use of the Site or the Services, Care.com reserves the right to send a notice thereof to other Registered Users with whom we believe the individual has corresponded.

    Our decision to terminate an individual's registration and/or to notify other Registered Users with whom we believe the individual has corresponded does not constitute, and should not be interpreted or used as information bearing on, the individual's character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living.
    Privacy

    Care.com will only use the information you provide on the Site or via other channels in accordance with our Privacy Policy. For more information, see our full Privacy Policy, the terms of which are incorporated herein.
    Links To External Sites

    Links from the Site to external sites (including external sites that are framed by Care.com) or inclusion of advertisements do not constitute an endorsement by Care.com of such sites or the content, products, advertising and other materials presented on such sites or of the products and services that are the subject of such advertisements, but are for users' reference and convenience.

    Users access them at their own risk. It is the responsibility of the user to evaluate the content and usefulness of the information obtained from other sites. Care.com does not control such sites, and is not responsible for their content. Just because Care.com has hyperlinks to such sites does not mean that Care.com endorses any of the material on such sites, or has any association with their operators.

    Users further acknowledge that use of any site controlled, owned or operated by third parties is governed by the terms and conditions of use for those sites, and not by Care.com's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Care.com expressly disclaims any liability derived from the use and/or viewing of links that may appear on this Site. All users hereby agree to hold Care.com harmless from any liability that may result from the use of links that may appear on the Site.
    Payment And Refund Policy

    In order to utilize some Care.com Services or product offerings, the user of such Services or product offerings must pay Care.com either a recurring subscription or one-time fee. In addition, the user is responsible for any state or local sales taxes associated with the Services or product offerings purchased.
        8.1 Billing and Payment

        If you sign up for a Care.com paid membership subscription, you agree to pay Care.com all subscription charges associated with the plan you subscribe to as described on the Site at the time you subscribe and provide your payment information. You also authorize Care.com to charge your chosen payment provider according to the terms of the plan to which you subscribe. The subscription period and the amount and frequency of the charges will vary depending on the subscription plan you select. Care.com reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment.

        To the extent you elect to purchase other Services or product offerings we may offer for a fee, you authorize Care.com to charge your chosen payment provider for the Services and/or products you purchase. You agree that if Care.com already has your credit card on file as a result of prior purchases you have made, we may charge that credit card for the additional Services/products you purchase.
        8.2 Automatic Subscription Renewal and Cancellation

        Care.com paid membership subscriptions will continue indefinitely until cancelled by the user. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically renew for an additional equivalent period as the subscription term you originally selected and at the subscription rate and frequency disclosed to you on the Site when you originally subscribed, unless otherwise provided at the time you subscribed. If you sign up for a payment plan that allows you to be charged monthly over the subscription period and you decide to cancel your subscription during the subscription period, you acknowledge and agree that you will continue to be billed for the subscription on a monthly basis until its originally scheduled expiration date.

        You may cancel your paid membership subscription by adjusting your account settings. If you cancel your subscription, you typically will be permitted to use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term. Your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires, but your credit card will be charged, and you will be required to pay, any cancellation or other fees associated with your early termination and disclosed to you at the time you signed up for the subscription plan.
        8.3 Refund Policy

        Except as set forth below, all payments for services/products are non-refundable and there are no refunds or credits for unused or partially used services/products or service/product cancellations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have a paid membership subscription that is automatically renewed, we will refund the most recent charge to your credit card if (i) you cancel your subscription within thirty (30) days after the most recent charge, and (ii) you have not used your subscription during the current renewal period. The refund will apply to the most recent charge only. In addition, Care.com reserves the right to immediately downgrade or cancel your membership after payment of your refund. Care.com does not provide refunds or credits under any other circumstances, unless it determines in its sole discretion that a refund or credit is warranted due to extenuating circumstances, such as a duplicate account.
        8.4 Free Trial Offers

        Care.com may offer limited-time free trial subscriptions to certain users from time-to-time. Users who sign up for a Care.com Service on a free trial basis may have limited access to the Service and/or features of the Site. If a user signs up for a free trial subscription, after the expiration of the free trial period, the user will be charged the price then in effect for a subscription to the Service, unless otherwise provided to him or her when he or she originally subscribed. If a user does not want to continue with the Service after the expiration of the free trial period, the Care Seeker or Care Provider must cancel their subscription within thirty (30) days of being charged the subscription fee for the Service. Upon cancellation, the Care Seeker or Care Provider's credit card will be refunded for the amount of the most recent subscription charge so long as he or she has not used the subscription after the expiration of the free trial period.
    Release of Liability for Conduct and Disputes

    We are not an employer of Care Providers. Care Seekers may seek the services of a Care Provider through the use of the Site or Services, and Care Providers may post profiles and submit proposals to Care Seekers regarding their services. In some instances, such as through the Care Concierge, HomeBase and Senior Care Planning Services, we or PIAP may provide Care Seekers a customized list of potential individuals, companies and/or agencies to consider based on the information the Care Seeker provides us regarding their and their loved one's needs and preferences. However, if a Care Seeker agrees on the provision of services from an individual, company or agency we or PIAP identifies through any of those Services, such agreement is solely between the Care Seeker and the Care Provider; neither Care.com nor PIAP is a party to any such agreement. In some instances, such as through the Backup Care Service and sometimes through the HomeBase Service, the third parties we or PIAP contract with to provide services in support of that Service select the individual Care Providers from their agency who provide the backup or senior care service. We and PIAP contract with only reputable agencies that have entered into an agreement with us pursuant to which they represent that each of their individual Care Providers has passed a vigorous screening process including background and reference checks. However, each such agency operates independently of Care.com and is not under our control. Any issues concerning the conduct of a Care Seeker or Care Provider including, without limitation, the services received by the Care Seeker or payment due to the Care Provider, must be resolved directly by the Care Seeker and the Care Provider. Care.com will not be held responsible and expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever for any claims, demands or damages direct or indirect of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such issues. By using this Site or our Services, you do hereby represent, understand, and expressly agree to hold Care.com harmless for any claim or controversy that may arise from any disputes between you and any Care Seeker, Care Provider or other user(s) of the Site. You agree to take reasonable precautions in all interactions with Care Seekers, Care Providers or other users of the Site or the Services, particularly if you decide to meet offline. In addition, you agree to visit the Care.com Safety Center prior to using the Service. By using the Site or the Services, you do hereby agree to report any alleged improprieties of any users therein to Care.com immediately by notifying Care.com of the same via electronic correspondence.
    Age Restrictions

    Except with respect to Teen Providers (as described in Section 3.3), Care.com is intended for people 18 or over. Care Seekers and Care Providers should monitor children's use of the Internet and deny access to the Site to anyone under the age of 18. Care.com will not knowingly collect any information from individuals under 13. You must identify your age during the registration process, and we do not assume any responsibility for any misrepresentations regarding your age when using this Site. Should we determine that you do not meet the age requirements for using our Site or Services, your registration will be terminated immediately.

        No Liability for non-Care.com Actions. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL CARE.COM BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, GENERAL, SPECIAL, COMPENSATORY, AND/OR CONSEQUENTIAL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE CONDUCT OF YOU OR ANYONE ELSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE SITE OR THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, BODILY INJURY, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, AND/OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ANYONE'S RELIANCE ON INFORMATION OR OTHER CONTENT POSTED ON THE SITE, OR TRANSMITTED TO OR BY ANY USERS OR ANY OTHER INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER REGISTERED USERS OF THE SITE OR SERVICES, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE. THIS INCLUDES ANY CLAIMS, LOSSES OR DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE CONDUCT OF USERS WHO HAVE REGISTERED UNDER FALSE PRETENSES OR WHO ATTEMPT TO DEFRAUD OR HARM YOU.

        In addition to the preceding paragraphs of this section and other provisions of these Terms, any advice that may be posted on the Site is for informational purposes only and is not intended to replace or substitute for any professional financial, medical, legal, or other advice.

Users further agree that they will cooperate as reasonably required in the defense of such claims.

    Agreement to Arbitrate
        13.1 Agreement to Arbitrate

        This Section 13 is referred to in these Terms as the "Arbitration Agreement". Unless you opt-out in accordance with the opt-out procedures set forth below, you agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Care.com or a Care.com Affiliate, whether relating to these Terms (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, the Site, or otherwise, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.
        13.2 Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief

        YOU AND CARE.COM AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND CARE.COM AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER CARE.COM USERS.
        13.3 Pre- Arbitration Dispute Resolution

        Care.com is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently. So before you commence arbitration, we suggest that you contact us to explain your complaint, as we may be able to resolve it without the need for arbitration. You may contact us via email at careteam@care.com or at Care.com, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 201 Jones Road, Suite 500, Waltham, MA 02451.
        13.4 Arbitration Procedures

        Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's ("AAA") rules and procedures, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA's Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA's consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration. If there is any inconsistency between the AAA Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would, including without limitation, the limitation of liability provisions in Section 11. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.

        To commence an arbitration against Care.com, you must complete a short form, submit it to the AAA, and send a copy to Care.com at Care.com, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 201 Jones Road, Suite 500, Waltham, MA 02451. For more information, see the AAA's claim filing page, http://www.adr.org/fileacase. You may represent yourself in the arbitration or be represented by an attorney or another representative. Once we receive your arbitration claim, we may assert any counterclaims we may have against you.

        The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less you or Care.com may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and Care.com subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at any in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or Care.com, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.

        The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Care.com users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Care.com user to the extent required by applicable law.
        13.5 Costs of Arbitration

        Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the "Arbitration Fees") will be governed by the AAA's Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Care.com will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Care.com will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Each party will be responsible for all other fees it incurs in connection with the arbitration, including without limitation, all attorney fees. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse Care.com for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Care.com on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.
        13.6 Confidentiality

        All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.
        13.7 Severability

        If a court decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement other than Section 13.2 is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court decides that any of the provisions of Section 13.2 is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. The remainder of the Terms will continue to apply.
        13.8 Opt-Out Procedure

        You can choose to reject this Arbitration Agreement by mailing us a written opt-out notice ("Opt-Out Notice") in accordance with the terms of this Section. For new Care.com users, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than 30 Days after the date you accept these Terms for the first time or August 20,2013, whichever is later. If you are already a current Care.com user and previously accepted the Care.com Terms prior to the introduction of this Arbitration Agreement, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than August 20, 2013. You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to Care.com, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 201 Jones Road, Suite 500, Waltham MA 02451. The Opt-Out Notice must state that you do not agree to the Arbitration Agreement and must include your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es) used to log in to the Care.com account(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, all other terms of these Terms will continue to apply. Opting out of the Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.
        13.9 Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement

        Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that change shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Care.com prior to the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we seek to terminate this Arbitration Agreement from these Terms, such termination shall not be effective until 30 days after the version of these Terms not containing the Arbitration Agreement is posted to the Site, and shall not be effective as to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Care.com prior to the effective date of removal.
    Governing Law and Jurisdiction

    These Terms, and any dispute between you and Care.com, shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to principles of conflicts of law, provided that the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of Section 13, the Arbitration Agreement. Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the Arbitration Agreement 13 is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute (except for small-claims court actions), either as a result of your decision to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Care.com must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. You and Care.com agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.
